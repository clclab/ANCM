# Welcome to ANCM'22

This website contains the lab assignments for the Advanced Neural and Cognitive Modelling course. You can access the assignments through the menu on the left.

To open a lab assignment in google colab, go to the assignment page and hover your mouse over the rocket symbol ( <img alt="rocket" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/6.x/svgs/solid/rocket.svg" width="20" height="20"> ) in the top right, then choose _Colab_. Once on colab, don't forget to make a copy of the notebook in your own Drive to save your changes. If you prefer working in your own local jupyter environment, you can also download ( <img alt="rocket" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/6.x/svgs/solid/download.svg" width="20" height="20"> ) the .ipynb file for any lab assignment.
